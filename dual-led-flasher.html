          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>This circuit is a rewarding first project — with just nine components you can get the satisfying effect of making LEDs light up and blink. The circuit’s functionality is charmingly complex despite its simplicity. Understanding how it works will provide a taste of the analog side of electronics, and is a fun puzzle!</p>

          <h3>Required Tools</h3>

          <p>You'll need a couple of additional tools and materials in order to put this kit together: a soldering iron (such as <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/2163">this one</a> optionally), and solder. You may like a "third hands" for holding the board while you working on it- or, if you like, you can use the wooden stand to hold the board while you solder. Batteries are not included in the kit, and you can choose to use the alligator clips to hook up a battery or power supply of your choosing, or you can assemble the SMT Battery Clip to the reverse side, in which case you'll want to supply either a 3V 2032 coin cell battery or two 3V 2016s (to form a 6V stack).

          </p>

          <h3>Assembly Steps</h3>

          <p>Many circuit builders find it helpful to assemble the components from shortest to tallest on the board. Start by inserting the four resistors, R1, R2, R3, and R4. Bend the leads outward to hold them in place while you solder them. You may consider using the wooden stand to hold the board at a pleasing angle while you solder. After this, insert the two transistors, and finally the remaining two capacitors and both LEDs. Then turn the PCB over, and as a final step, attach by soldering the SMT battery clip into place. If you like, you may also choose to clean the solder flux a bit using the alcohol pad, and you can assemble the included rubber feet either onto the circuit board (to give it a bit of grip laying flat) or onto the bottom of the wooden stand for long-term display.</p>
