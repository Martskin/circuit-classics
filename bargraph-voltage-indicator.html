          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>This circuit lets you become a scientist and an engineer and marks the passage of that important milestone of using tools you have constructed yourself. With your own voltmeter you can measure batteries or use it to explore and understand other electronic circuits that you find in the world.</p>

          <h3>Assembly Steps</h3>

          <p>Insert low, flat components first, such as the 1k resistors. You may consider using the wooden stand to hold the board at a pleasing angle while you solder it. After fully inserting each resistor, bend the leads so that it stays in place while you turn the board over to solder it. Insert the LM339 chip and solder the #1 and #8 pins of the chip to ensure that it is fully inserted and held in place, then solder each of the next legs in order. After this, insert and solder the LEDs, and then the potentiometer. Then turn the PCB over, and as a final step, attach by soldering the SMT battery clip into place.</p>

          <h3>Testing</h3>

          <p>All four LEDs should be on when you power this circuit up, if you have built it correctly, as long as you are not using the white alligator clip on IN+ to measure a voltage. You can test the circuit by using it to measure itself - at one of the gold test points along the left-hand-side of the board. The potentiometer knob adjusts the sensitivity of the circuit (this might be useful if you are measuring a voltage that is much lower than the battery/supply voltage you are using, for example.) Remember: always measure a voltage that is less than what is powering this circuit.</p>
